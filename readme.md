#### An app that allows search in the given inventory by any of the following:

- Hotel Name
- Destination [City]
- Price range [ex: $100:$200]
- Date range [ex: 10-10-2020:15-10-2020]

and allow sorting by:

- Hotel Name
- Price

####  Stack
- Angular : v1.7.3
- NodeJS : v9.11.2
- Continuous Integration : Travis CI
- Code Quality : Codebeat

## Continuous Integration

- Fetch the data directly from the URL and not create a JSON file
- You can use PHP >= 7.1 or NodeJs =>9.x or both to accomplish this task
- Write Unit tests for both Frontend & Backend application
- Implement [travis](https://travis-ci.org) or [scrutinizer-ci](https://scrutinizer-ci.com) or any other CI tool for the project, Add the build status badges to your project README file
- Use [codeclimate](https://codeclimate.com) or any other alternative to estimate the code quality and add it's badge to your project README file
- Do not use any database or full text search engines
- If you make any assumptions while solving the exercise please mention them clearly in the readme file

## What we are looking for

- **Simple, clear, readable code** How well structured it is? Clear separation of concerns? Can anyone just look at it and get the idea to
what is being done? Does it follow any standards?
- **Correctness** Does the application do what it promises? Can we find bugs or trivial flaws?
- **Memory efficiency** How will it behave in case of large datasets?
- **Testing** How well tested your application is? Can you give some metrics?
